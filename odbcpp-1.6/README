To generate the documentation with doxygen, use:

   doxygen doc/odbcpp.doxy

If necessary, copy the odbcpp.doxy file from your build environment.
(in case you ran the configure script in a sub-folder)

Under MS-Windows, install Doxygen and if necessary fix the vcproj
project to point at the right place then Build the documentation.

The documentation is also available online at:

   http://www.m2osw.com/odbcpp_docs

You may want to look at the run script.
